## Summary

The vulnerabilities in the OpenSSL Security releases of Jul 5th 2022 affects Node.js v18.x, v16.x, and v14.x.

* Node.js is affected by **one** MODERATE vulnerability on Windows 32-Bit x86.

The [next](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/july-2022-security-releases/) Node.js Security Release will update all the OpenSSL versions.

## Analysis

Our assessment of the [security advisory](https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2022-July/000232.html) is:

### Heap memory corruption with RSA private key operation (CVE-2022-2274) (HIGH)

This vulnerability affects OpenSSL 3.0.4 users. However, Node.js haven't ship any version using the OpenSSL 3.0.4.
Therefore, Node.js is not affected.

### AES OCB fails to encrypt some bytes (CVE-2022-2097) (MODERATE)

This vulnerability affects Windows 32-Bit x86 users using `AES OCB` encryption. The serverity is MODERATE.
