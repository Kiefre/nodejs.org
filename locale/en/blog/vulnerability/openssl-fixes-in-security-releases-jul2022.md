## Summary

The vulnerabilities in the OpenSSL Security releases of Jul 5th 2022 do not affect any active Node.js release lines.

Although, the Node.js Security Release will update all the OpenSSL versions.

## Analysis

Our assessment of the [security advisory](https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2022-July/000232.html) is:

### Heap memory corruption with RSA private key operation (CVE-2022-2274) (HIGH)

This vulnerability affects OpenSSL 3.0.4 users. However, Node.js haven't ship any version using the OpenSSL 3.0.4.
Therefore, Node.js is not affected.


### AES OCB fails to encrypt some bytes (CVE-2022-2097) (MODERATE)

// TODO

### Contact and future updates

The current Node.js security policy can be found at <https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/HEAD/SECURITY.md#security>,
including information on how to report a vulnerability in Node.js.
